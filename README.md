Screen recorder is a wrapper around VLC desktop screen recording capability with a very simple API.

Capture codec is optimized to VLC real time capture best setting (ogg/theo, hight bitrate).
Feel free to transcode/re-encode as please you afterward.

# Note
ffmpeg can also grab desktop, yet, we prefer a minimal (bundled) VLC for its ability to expose a telnet/rc interface and start capture very quickly (as the VLC process is already running in the background).


# Installation
```
npm install screen-capture-recorder
```


# API

```
'use strict';

const Recorder = require('./');
const sleep = require('nyks/function/sleep');

(async() => {

  const scene = new Recorder( {x : 0, y : 0 , w : 640 , h : 480} );
  await scene.warmup();
  await scene.StartRecord();
  await sleep(5000);
  const moviePath = await scene.StopRecord();
  console.log(moviePath);
})();


```
